# AI Symposium 2026

> A simulated AI conference featuring diverse agentic personas delivering perspectives on "AI in 2026: Looking Forward"

## Core Concept

This project explores **perspective synthesis through agentic AI**—using AI agents to simulate a conference where diverse personas (HR professionals, CEOs, doctors, artists, skeptics, enthusiasts, and many more) each deliver a 3-minute speech on AI's impact from their unique vantage point.

Unlike a panel discussion (which requires complex rebuttal orchestration) or a think tank (which requires institutional memory), this is a clean, one-time event: an orchestration agent distributes prompts to sub-agents, collects their speeches, and compiles the output.

## Status

🚧 **Design Phase** — Defining agents, methodology, and implementation approach

## Output Formats

- **PDF**: Concatenated speeches with agent introductions
- **Audio**: TTS-rendered conference with MC introductions and voice diversity

## Related Experiments

This project is part of a broader exploration of agentic AI for perspective synthesis:

- **AI Panel** — Multi-agent debate with rebuttal mechanics
- **AI Think Tank** — Persistent institution with memory and publication workflows
- **Agentic UN** — Simulated General Assembly with structured voting
- **Peace in the Middle East** — Geopolitical ideation challenge
