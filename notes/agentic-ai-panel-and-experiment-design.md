All right, this is a, um, these are notes, audio notes in my, in my new format for, um, something I really wanna try out and I think as this will be great, I've working on some, uh, very fun text stuff lately, so this will be a nice, nice thing to really I'd love to just try this one out. So, um, this fits into with my few experiments I've been trying that I'm really interested in exploring, using AI for the the use case of, I guess it's hard to define, but, uh, perspective exploration, um, synthesized personalities, agentic personas, um, I think is a totally fascinating area of what AI could be useful for. Imperfect of course like everything else is, but, um, some previous ones that I've tried out are, um, an AI panel. And the panel is one that I tried to short run on. And I actually think that this might be an easier and better better test case to try out the kind of pattern on because a, from an orchestration standpoint, the concept of a panel is a little bit con- complicated. Uh, I tried to model it out in a sketch. A panel would typically involve a panel, you know, uh, um, gosh, what do they call those people? The moderator, a moderator, a convener, the panelists and I tried to create a panel whereby it's realistic in the sense that the panelists present their viewpoints and also argue with the other panelists in a way that isn't totally chaotic. So, elements of, um, rebuttal and argumentation baked into each each turn on the panel. Uh, but that's obviously quite a, quite a complex design, although it could be very interesting. Another one just mentioning by way of kind of project consolidation and ones that are kind of in this pattern I think and all are all very uh, worth I'm very excited to be looking into just as uh, as as as open- ended research in this in this coming year. And that is uh, an AI think tank. That one was a little bit the idea for that was a, a think tank typically being a vehicle that doesn't just kind of convene once, it's an ongoing, um, it's an ongoing institution with institutional memory. And that was distinct from the panel. That was my reason for viewing it as a distinct experiment and why I think it does have very independent, um, experimentational value because you kind of open up the idea of a panel convening periodically or or or a think tank, I mean, um, it also I thought was a good one because of the way think tanks kind of operate in the sense that they tend to work from problems to ideation solutions and then towards publications and that actually fit perfectly with an agentic model of gather define the topic, gather perspectives, catenate those into PDFs, audio streams, audio uh, books, et cetera. So, that's one that's that's good. Um, peace in the Middle East is another one on my on my list of ones that I've modeled out. Uh, these are just kind of mostly waiting for me to have a have have some time to actually spend on stuff that is totally 100% open source and not connected in any way to, um, to other other other projects. Um, but that's obviously kind of like a a huge geopolitical that's that's an attempt is thinking can AI tools actually bring fresh ideation to a geopolitical challenge that is like about as intractable as it comes. Um, so one that's actually I think extremely interesting. Agentic UN, reason that's different, um, a multilateral forum when it votes on issues, my thinking was that the voting process, if, you know, if the if we created us a surrogate UN uh, General Assembly where we know we've a defined list of companies sorry, countries, we have ISO codes, the votes can be, you know, uh, in favor against or abstain. So, that very rigid definition of the participants and the voting mechanism actually lends itself in my view extremely well to structured outputs and agentic systems where if you can configure the country reps, you can configure the resolutions, and then it's just orchestrating those, pass those out to the simulated countries, gather their simulated votes. In my first experiment, I added it, I added the ability for the sym- the country to, um, to provide a statement alongside its vote to the resolution, then gather that data from the simulated run and put it through an analysis layer. So that's a simulation for modeling geopolitical fora and uh, and uh, policy reactions. Um, so this one, to add to the the kind of uh, pile of ideas that I have for how all of I think just amazing ways this concept could be explored is distinguished by, I think, okay, this is actually kind of a a good way to start looking at this because it's it's less daunting than trying to con- figure out a way to convene a realistic imaginary summit. Uh, this is just a one-time simulated conference and unlike the panel, there isn't that element of rebuttal being uh, woven in where they're deliberately told and you have to sit there and think, how do I pass this agent's position to the next one without degrading the context window? So it's almost cleaner. And the concept is basically, um, the one that I want to do and I'm gonna sketch out all the various personas as as as my planning for this test first implementation. Today is January the 1st, 2026 and the topic of this conference can be something that kind of sounds like a pretty generic tech conference, like AI in 2026 looking forward. Uh, sub-titled, perspectives from a diverse, you know, or a diverse, uh, or a diverse range of contributors. And the structure is this, each agent uh, gets the panel gets as context data, you're speaking at this panel, you have to give a speech. You can you can uh, deliver up to X many words. And I'll get to the idea for the that constraint and that's it. So it's really just actually an orchestration agent passing out the system prompts to sub agents for text generation. That's the first kind of layer of it. Um, the ones that I want to have, the idea is to gather different perspectives. That's where I see this as being really interesting. So, I'm gonna just kind of notch through or whittle through, um, the ones that I think in this particular first attempts it would be would be would be uh, interesting. And what each one will be instructed to focus on. Okay, number one, in no particular order for the just the the agent configurations. And these may be poorly grouped, so the reason I'm capturing this as as audio and transcribing it will be to tighten up all of the design notes uh, with AI of course. Number one, human resources, uh, this is talking about the uh, the HR perspective. What do human resources think about AI in 2026? How were they been challenged by it to date? Um, and where is their focus? Are they leveraging it for for for sifting through candidates for jobs, for recruiting, and how are they dealing with the challenge of every candidate now using it and they're they're must HR departments presumably being swamped by maybe a degrading caliber of AI generated applications. Number two, um, CEO of a of a uh, small company. This character would be trying to provide, sorry, CEO of a small company is kind of a bad bad fit, maybe just the manager of a small company. Uh, small organization non-technical giving their perspective on AI adoption. How do they feel? They're not a the kind of the typical pitch market for tech tools. What what have they made of AI to date? Has it actually been helpful in their non-technical uh, business? And for each of these, the agents need to be given a a credible fake. So the orchestrator needs to, needs to add to the system prompt, you are the CEO of X, a textiles company, framing store, you know, something to fit the mold of the persona. Um, next one, a startup CEO, startup CTO in fact. Um, so very much at the forefront of adopting technology, they're a startup, they're eager to disrupt, but they're not an AI startup, they're just they're something unrelated, Fintech maybe. What's that been their vantage point today and what's w- what are they looking for for All all of them the perspectives are looking what are they kind of what have they gained so far from their journey with AI and what are they kind of expecting in 2026? Opportunities and threats. Um, then enterprise CEO of an enterprise. So it's a looking deliberately at the non-technical leadership, the the the, you know, the kind of high-level perspective. Uh, what does it make of it so far? Has it really seen, you know, advantages? Um, other industry viewpoints, C S O. No, yes, CSO, Chief Strategy Officer. Someone whose entire job is strategy formulation for a large company. And their focus is business strategy and maximizing the use of AI. What what are they seeing in terms of their strategic vision? Finally, in the industry pool, industry perspectives pool or track, maybe we can um, run this track by track, CISOs, Chief Information Security Officer focus very squarely on the cybersecurity aspect and organizational security. What what are they what are their concerns be? What what do they view as the kind of emerging threat landscape? Okay. Um, actually, and within industry, we also need to we should also get the perspective of workers of course. Um, employee at a small, medium, and large organization. One of each. Um, and one employee at a tech forward organization, the maybe even an AI company itself. How have they been using AI internally? Do they do they feel any dissonance between what they're marketing and uh, what they're feeling from their own adoption of the tool? Industry analysis layer, um, simulated analysts, sector analysts, uh, it's a company like McKinsey, whose task is to provide dispassionate analysis of, you know, they're used to advising industry upon the the trends as they see them. And their task is to is to give a speech presenting a their their viewpoint, the vantage point from the consulting side of things, let's say. Um, I want to include a couple of government actors as well. So the, um, the Prime Minister of a of a of a simulated country who arrives in a simulated motorcade. That puts a joke. Um, and its perspective can be again, we'll have to pass the name f- of a fictitious country. You're you're very, you know, the most high-level person in your in your country as such. You're you're worried about your citizens. What do what does AI mean to you? What do you feel about its role in society at large? Um, one from the a municipal level uh, government person, like the maybe the mayor of a of a town who might be sort of leadership in rollout municipal rollout of AI technology. Uh, one perspective that'd be great would be smart city a smart city planner, very, very specific, very much, you know, implementation level. Um, and put very stringent requirements for security and cyber cybersecurity. Have they been making much use of AI? What are they feeling about it at the moment? Um, next one, I think should be an AI skeptic. Someone who's uh, m- remember the population who's been somehow invited to this symposium who's just like extremely negative and critical about everything related to AI. Um, their task is to really tear apart AI today and cast a dim view over its future. Next one, AI hyper enthusiast, maybe an AI consultant, could be someone like me. Um, they're mega enthusiastic about AI, they live and breathers. And they're here to just kind of spread their dogma. In so they're the like kind of extreme, extreme, um, in fact, I think this could be split into two. One consultant who's kind of just standard enthusiastic about AI. The next one is someone who actually thinks our our adoption of AI is incredibly slow. They're actually saying, yeah, we're b- we're using it, but we're not using it in any we're near as much as we could be and as far reaching and it we're we're we're cave men who think we're high tech. Uh, the next one, so these are kind of just perspectives from like general society. This would be really fascinating. I ho- I hope this turns out well. We'll we'll see we'll see what comes of this. Um, educational layer participants. Simulated provost of a university. What are they seeing among among their feelings about AI in higher tech? Uh, headmaster of a uh, of a high school. Career counselor at a high school. What are they advising that population about AI? They're, you know, people who are maybe choosing their college course, trying to figure out what to do with their careers, their lives. What kind of what are they hearing from people they're counseling and what are they, um, what are they thinking? Speaking of counseling, one who is uh, legal, a lawyer. Uh, regular lawyer in a in a medium-sized city in in in tech, whatever, calling our fake country, Republic of Techland. And they're just I I guess what's interesting here is, okay, you're you're involved in in a, in a leg- in in law, um, are you using AI? Are you using your colleagues use AI? Do you think it's actually helpful? Do you think it's overhyped? Uh, next one, I'm trying to think of other kind of traditional or classic professionals. Architects, my wife's an architect, so it's uh, close close to me. Um, same questions really. What have you made of it so far? Do you feel, are you maybe there's some some specific ones. Are you using cloud AI? Are you using local AI? Are you using comfy UI? Does your business, does your office own a GPU? What your colleagues make of it? Um, engineering is another one. Uh, doctor, a family doctor. And this will really be like kind of just gamut scanning the it's like what Anthropic's AI perspective tried recently, but but with agents. Um, family doctor and then a consultant. So, kind of the mo- the level of medicine that the most people deal with day to day in the population, are you using it for diagnosis? Be honest. Um, do you find it helpful? Have you used it for your personal health? How often have you looked up patients' uh, symptoms on a on chat GPT while they're while they don't see your screen? Are you using specialist AI tools? because there's some of those have kind of come on the market grounded in medical journals? Are you just are you just using chat GPT? Um, I'm leaving out so many things. Uh, utility operator, again operational technology. Um, academia. No, before I talk about academia, actually there's a very important one, parenting. Parenting experts, um, what are you advising parents upon AI and and children like when uh, ethics, exposure, safety risks. Um, a children's education expert, kind of the same question but very focused on the role of this role in like education. Can you what do we do about kids' shows that are made by AI? Do we need to like check them as carefully as other content? Um, I'm particularly enthusiastic about the idea of using generative AI for kind of kids' content actually. It's one of my secret uh, long-term AI aspirations and I've done a few kind of little lullabies and funny songs on Suno, so I'd like to get a an enthusia fellow enthusiast on our panel who also thinks it can be bring a lot of joy to children. Um, that is, that is good. Um, AI censorship and bias. Representative of a think tank exploring AI bias, um, what it means, where we are, where the big model labs are. Speaking of the big model labs, someone from the big model lab, a big model lab who's there to share their vision for what they want to do in in this year. Someone from a small model lab, an open-coming model lab who's trying to break through and break out in an increasingly crowded market. Um, someone who's doing kind of the stuff that I do, AI consultancy, they're working with at the kind of ground level, um, working with businesses implementing AI. What do you feel? Like what what have you what have you heard so far from your clients about their challenges, opportunities? Um, do you worry about the fact that it's going to be it's a booming market, everyone's going to brand themselves as a, um, as an AI consultant? Uh, speaking of that train of thought, what about upskilling and training? Maybe someone who does this for living, they advise people upon career upskilling and continuous professional development. Um, what have they seen so far in terms of skill gaps? What have they heard about skill gaps from employers? What are they advising people? Um, I'll try to do some silence truncation on this voice note. I think we got a pretty diverse pretty good cross-section of society already here, but, uh, I feel like there's still many gaps. Um, totally unredacted audio including gross sounds of me drinking water. AI in foreign policy because it's something I'm so interested in. This idea of decision-making and AI, we we kind of covered the government, but, um, I'd love to ac- actually, oh, here's one, military. Um, probably wouldn't happen in the real world or maybe it would, but a military technologist comes to speak to the conference, uh, by and actually shares what they can in the open domain about how the army is using AI or the military. Um, how significant it is in in modern warfare, what the challenges are in terms of defense in AI, um, and then the geopolitical dimension will be really fascinating too. East versus west. Someone comes to the conference who represents the Chinese uh, AI vendor. He talks about the differences between AI adoption in the east and the west to date, um, and what over there in uh, in China or, you know, other places in the east, in the east of the world, they're seeing, um, AI the dynamics they're seeing. Also be fascinating actually to get someone from a developing uh, a lower less developed country, um, talking about how AI, the kind of maybe developmental aspect of AI in terms of access to it, affordability as a first and place is where maybe might make the biggest impact. One, speaking of impact, an advocate for impact as a field, commonly associated with a field called impact investing, uh, their perspective is on just kind of what they're seeing in terms of use, where where they're excited about AI. Um, that brings us nicely to actually some the fact the world of finance, a financial regulator, a central banker, uh, AI's used in making sense of, you know, the kind of giant heaps of data we see in uh, in the world of economics that moves quicker than people can get that information. Um, a trader, a day trader, someone using AI tools in their, in their uh, in their actual trading strategies. Uh, one who represents someone maybe more like me, just like a regular regular chump, uh, with a pension, trying to make sure that they're, you know, they're putting their money in in a smart way. Um, what's their perspective been? And then someone who advises the regular chumps like me on this kind of stuff. Um, like a, like a regular financial advisor, not not not too, um, not too kind of the the rich and the famous, but to just regular savers. Um, someone from a non-English speaking country uh, just re- remember the population who can speak English and they they share what the AI looks like in in small languages. Let's take someone from Denmark, a pretty fairly small language. And what's the what's the scene like over there as in, you know, the big models are trained on English and let's take someone who who in that population who doesn't know English and those less those languages which have less speakers, how is AI like what are the tools like? Is it ar- is it still kind of like are they are they like significantly worse than the e- someone who someone from, let's say Denmark again, who has because they're a Danish speaker, they've used both, um, let's say tools just marketed for their language and conventional tools like chat GPT and they're able to kind of see from their own experience the differences there. Um, here's a random one. Someone who's a, um, a producer at Netflix. And they're challenged by AI-generated content in the productions they're assessing and what the policies are like there. Another one that I've actually been involved with through, um, through work stuff is the publishing industry. Someone at a major publisher, we cannot, we can use proxies for all of these. I think it makes it more more fun when and that takes away the kind of copyright, speaking of copyright the kind of, you know, potential to create a fake AI persona based on a real named entity that then says something uh, very much out of out of brand or whatever. Um, so we'll we'll come up with a fake publisher uh, that represents someone like a big name in publishing. And they're looking at of course are their authors using AI to generate books that they're vetting for publication and maybe that they're representing. Um, let's also create a model published author. They've already published a book, not self-published, but published in the mainstream. Are they using AI? They probably know other published authors, um, are they using AI too? Speaking of the world of writing and content, a journalist. Um, and a copy editor, some of the most nitpicky people one can ever hope to encounter or not hope. Um, what are what what are their thoughts? I used to work with a couple of very entertaining copy editors. Um, are they, do they suspect their reporters are using AI all the time? Have they caught a reporter red-handed? And for the reporters, um, when they're writing that wh- when they're uh, writing and creating news, that's going to be read by, if they're working for a busy newswire potentially tens of millions of people, and the stakes are kind of high. They don't want to lose their job or become a new story themselves. Uh, how do they feel about approaching AI tools? Um, a religious leader, I'm uh, Jewish, so a rabbi would be really interesting to me. Are you are you using it for your uh, for your Torah lessons? Be honest. Um, and then someone from another another faith, uh, Muslim cleric, uh, to hear the ask the same question. But I don't, again, I don't want to get into kind of very too much uh, politically charged uh, territories uh, or or areas. But speaking of sp- speaking of politically charged areas, um, we talked about military, an intelligence agency. Someone, the national intelligence agency sent someone, um, in, you know, who's who's can speak to the press. Um, and they disclose their feelings about AI. Uh, are they using it? They're obviously dealing with crazy amounts of data and trying to thwart, um, organized crime. Um, maybe an organized crime person, like like a mafioso, who's been in our in our imaginary experiment, they've been promised uh, promised uh, you know, non-prosecution or som- something. Here's another one. I I'm I think there's a huge a potential use case for AI, a really powerful one in fact, in what in anonymization and obfuscation. Meaning people who might, a whistleblowing, people who mightn't have felt for various reasons they couldn't come forth with, um, with something and AI as a language model, um, is amazing at just saying, take this, change all the names, change all the details, but keep the facts. Um, and I think that there is, I don't, not sure I've actually seen any tool for this yet. Although I've tried a couple of experimentary workflows myself. Um, and I don't know who we could get to represent this, but like, uh, you know, a serious issue where let's take, I don't know, sexual violence, domestic violence, where people are are, you know, massively in fear of retribution or or scared and they might have to think creatively about their use of AI for this reason, to protect themselves. Um, have they thought about it? Have they heard of anyone doing this? What tools do they use? And, uh, there's probably like a million and one other ones, um, but, oh, thinking something very operational and data heavy and I thought about the the air transport industry. Real-time, we didn't talk about the scientific sector, science. Uh, data analyst. But I think for V1 I'll just keep that to that already pretty long list of personas and okay. That's end of personas list. Now, because that's a lot of people, a lot of synthesized agents, I want to keep it short so that each one has three minutes, delivers a three-minute speech. Three minutes we can compute what the average word speaking rate is, and then in the first pass, using Gemini 3, which is incredibly cost-effective, an important note, using Gemini 3 with search enabled. Vital, so that we can have up-to-date grounding. That that stage is absolutely essential because otherwise we can't have agents reflecting on 2025 create with an AI model that thinks it's 2024. If that doesn't work, fallback can be Tavi, but that's an essential step or perplexity, but I think Gemini will be good enough. So uh, the constraint in the first step of the experiment is each person has delivers a three-minute speech, which means Gemini generates enough text that it would take about three minutes to read. And then text to speech. For the text to speech layer, I don't know how many agents that amounted to. But I'm thinking two things because the ultimate delivery delive- delivery vehicle I see is being, this could be really interesting, would be the following. One is a PDF, just a text document. You, um, we take the outputs, give each uh, the title page, like agent two, represents their name. The name would be something like diplomat, the diplomatic core would have been a good one actually. Um, in foreign policy, maybe for V2. Uh, so there's a title and then just a short description. This agent is instructed to represent a model uh, proxy for a um, McKinsey person. This was their response. Then the agent responds, then next page. So that that's just basically concatenating responses into into a PDF. But the format that I personally like the best and I think would be way more way more enjoyable to listen to if they are only three minutes each, so it's fairly short and snappy, TTS. And I'd like to also have because it's auditory, um, an MC, which can be a stable voice, and the MC just introduces each speaker because otherwise we don't know who they're, who they're, which agent this is. So the MC voice would say, next speaker is agent three. Agent three is representing a investment banker focused on this, a short introduction. And then a little pause before and after, which I've learned from my my errors is necessary because otherwise they'll just go back to back. And then and then the next agent. And then the concatenation logic there is is just putting all the audio chunks together, which I've worked, which I've done many times for podcasts and actually works very, very well. The TTS the actual only challenge I can think of is is voices, voice diversity. Um, however many agents that is, I'm making a mental note to myself that I think I'll actually run this experiment for TTS using Resemble AI because I like, I like their technology a lot. Um, I'm using it for my AI podcast, offhand promotion called mywordprompts.com. And they have a huge voice library, so I can just pick, round up 30 voices so that we don't, you know, it's not you're not hearing different agents in the same voice and it sounds it sounds off. So I'll select 30 voice IDs spanning just different types of voices to give some variety. And finally, in the experiment MC introduction, welcome to the conference and then after all the agents are over, a closure. Final step could be like kind of a a summary summarization agent, so after we've gathered all the individual responses, um, one agent who takes that huge heap of context data, Gemini 3 again might actually handle this because it even aggregated, it's it's probably within context window and its task is generating a summary. It can be a 10-minute, it can generate again text and also an audio summary. I'm personally would find the the first of those audio outputs the much more, the one I'm, I'd be much more excited about listening to, the direct perspectives. And we should add in the system prompt for the perspectives that they're told to just be yourself and talk as if you're at this conference. No formalities needed or or whatever. And that's the end of my experiment design. And I'm just gonna place a note because what I was thinking, this is the stretch experiment that would be it's kind of futuristic, but everything right now that seems futuristic becomes feasible in in AI pretty quickly. It's it's very very amazing. Um, I thought that avatars, like speaking avatars would be amazing for this, like literally there's, I don't know if this could be done. I say that time and time again and then people invent stuff that makes things possible. The background is like literally a podium or, you know, a stage. An avatar comes up, they speak as if it's like a TED conference or something. And then they go off stage and then the next person comes up, so like an actual video. Less ambitious implementation will be just kind of talking heads that could definitely be done, but, um, it wouldn't be that fun to watch. But, um, to keep it cheap and cheerful while experimenting and just trying out, can AI do this? This would be super cool. I'd love to try this. I'm gonna just do the simple text and audio pattern, which doesn't actually end up being that expensive and it's a very worthwhile use of a few dollars in my opinion. So, that's the plan. I'm going to now send this transcription to Gemini. I'm going to deliberately include this transcription in the repository. Uh, just it's my new, it's my on- it's my method. I open source the method and the and the occasionally useful results. And uh, it also just as as a side point, is a useful one to do this with because it's over 30 minutes and it shows that multi-model models, multi-model audio models can actually process um, audio of this length and much more, which is actually very, very cool because that's my, um, what I'm working on, a voice text solution. I can say no more.
