  "transcript": "All right, this is a um, these are notes—audio notes in my new format for something I really want to try out. And I think as this will be great. I've been working on some very fun text stuff lately, so this will be a nice, nice thing to really, I'd love to just try this one out.\n\nSo, this fits in with my few experiments I've been trying that I'm really interested in exploring, using AI for the use case of, I guess it's hard to define, but uh, perspective exploration, um, synthesized personalities, agentic personas—um, I think is a totally fascinating area of what AI could be useful for.\n\nImperfect, of course, like everything else is, but um, some previous ones that I've tried out are um, an AI panel. And the panel is one that I tried a short run on, and I actually think that this might be an easier and better test case to try out the kind of pattern on because a from an orchestration standpoint, the concept of a panel is a little bit complicated. Uh, I tried to model it out in a sketch.\n\nA panel would typically involve a panel, you know, um—gosh, what do they call those people? The moderator. A moderator, a convener, the panelists. And I tried to create a panel whereby it's realistic in the sense that the panelists present their viewpoints and also argue with the other panelists in a way that isn't totally chaotic.\n\nSo, elements of um, rebuttal and argumentation baked into each, each turn on the panel. Uh, but that's obviously quite a, quite a complex design, although it, it could be very interesting. Another one, just mentioning by way of kind of project consolidation and ones that are kind of in this pattern, I think and all, are all very uh, worth—I'm very excited to be looking into, just as uh, as as as open-ended research in this, in this coming year.\n\nAnd that is uh, an AI think tank. That one was a little bit, the idea for that was, a think tank typically being a vehicle that doesn't just kind of convene once. It's an ongoing, um, it's an ongoing institution with institutional memory. And that was distinct from the panel. That was my reason for viewing it as a distinct experiment and why I think it does have very independent, um, experimentation value because you kind of open up the idea of a panel convening periodically or, or or a think tank. I mean, um, it also I thought was a good one because of the way think tanks kind of operate in the sense that they tend to work from problems to ideation and solutions, and then towards publications, and that actually fit perfectly with an agentic model of gather, define the topic, gather perspectives, concatenate those into PDFs, audio streams, audio uh, books, etc.\n\nSo, that's one that's, that's good. Um, peace in the Middle East is another one on my, on my list of ones that I've modeled out. Uh, these are just kind of mostly waiting for me to have uh, have have some time to actually spend on stuff that is totally 100% open source and not connected in any way to um, to other other other projects. Um, but that's obviously kind of like a a huge geopolitical—that's, that's an attempt at thinking can AI tools actually bring fresh ideation to a geopolitical challenge that is like about as intractable as it comes. Um, so one that's actually I think extremely interesting.\n\n### Agentic UN\n\nAgentic UN—reason that's different? Um, a multilateral forum when it votes on issues. My thinking was that the voting process, if you know, if the, if we created a surrogate UN General Assembly where we know we have a defined list of companies—sorry, countries. We have ISO codes, the votes can be, you know, uh, in favor, against, or abstain. So that very rigid definition of the participants and the voting mechanism actually lends itself, in my view, extremely well to structured outputs and agentic systems where if you can configure the country reps, you can configure the resolutions, and then it's just orchestrating those, pass those out to the simulated countries, gather their simulated votes. In my first experiment, I added, I added the ability for the country to um, to provide a statement alongside its vote to the resolution. Then gather that data from the simulated run and put it through an analysis layer. So that's a simulation for modeling geopolitical fora and uh, and uh, policy reactions.\n\n### Simulated Conference\n\nUm, so this one, to add to the, the kind of pile of ideas that I have for how all the I think just amazing ways this concept could be explored, is distinguished by, I think, okay, this is actually kind of a good way to start looking at this because it's, it's less daunting than trying to figure out a way to convene a realistic imaginary summit. Uh, this is just a one-time simulated conference, and unlike the panel, there isn't that element of rebuttal being uh, woven in where they're deliberately told and you have to think how do I pass this agent's position to the next one without degrading the context window, so it's almost cleaner. And the concept is basically um, the one that I want to do, and I'm going to sketch out all the various personas as, as as my planning for this test first implementation.\n\nToday is January the 1st, 2026, and the topic of this conference can be something that kind of sounds like a pretty generic tech conference, like “AI in 2026: Looking Forward”. Uh, subtitle: \"Perspectives from a diverse, you know, our diverse uh, our diverse range of contributors.\" And the structure is this: each agent gets the panel, gets as context data: “You're speaking at this panel, you have to give a speech, you can, you can uh, deliver up to X many words.” And I'll get to the idea for the, that constraint. And that's it. So it's really just actually an orchestration agent passing out the system prompts to sub-agents for text generation. That's the first kind of layer of it.\n\nUm, the ones that I want to have, the idea is to gather different perspectives. That's where I see this as being really interesting. So, I'm going to just kind of notch through or whittle through um, the ones that I think in this particular first attempt would be, would be, would be uh, interesting, and what each one will be instructed to focus on.\n\nOkay, number one—in no particular order for the, just the, the agent configurations. And these may be poorly grouped, so the reason I'm capturing this as audio and transcribing it will be to tighten up all of the design notes uh, with AI, of course.\n\n#### Agent Configurations\n\nNumber one—human resources. Uh, this is talking about the uh, the HR perspective. What do human resources think about AI in 2026? How have they been challenged by it to date? Um, and where is their focus? Are they leveraging it for, for, for sifting through candidates for jobs, for recruiting, and how are they dealing with the challenge of every candidate now using it, and they're, they're must, HR departments presumably being swamped by maybe a degrading caliber of AI-generated applications.\n\nNumber two, um, CEO of a, of a uh, small company. This character would be trying to provide—sorry, CEO of a small company is kind of a bad, bad fit. Maybe just the manager of a small company. Uh, small organization, non-technical, giving their perspective on AI adoption. How do they feel? They're not a the kind of the typical pitch market for tech tools. What, what have they made of AI to date? Has it actually been helpful in their non-technical uh, business? And for each of these, the agents need to be given a a credible fake—so the orchestrator needs to, needs to add to the system prompt: “You are the CEO of X, a textiles company, a framing store.” You know, something to fit the mold of the persona.\n\nUm, next one, a startup CEO, startup CTO, in fact. Um, so very much at the forefront of adopting technology. They're a startup, they're eager to disrupt, but they're not an AI startup. They're just, they're something unrelated—FinTech, maybe. What's been their vantage point to date and what's, what are they looking for? For all, all of them, the perspectives are looking, what are they kind of, what have they gained so far from their journey with AI, and what are they kind of expecting in 2026? Opportunities and threats.\n\nUm, then enterprise—CEO of an enterprise. So it's looking deliberately at the non-technical leadership, the, the, the, you know, the kind of high-level perspective. Uh, what does it make of it so far? Has it really seen, you know, advantages? Um, other industry viewpoints—CSO—no, yes, CSO, Chief Strategy Officer. Someone whose entire job is strategy formulation for a large company, and their focus is business strategy and maximizing the use of AI. What, what are they seeing in terms of their strategic vision?\n\nFinally, in the industry pool, industry perspectives pool, or track—maybe we can um, run this track by track—CISOs. Chief Information Security Officer, focus very squarely on the cybersecurity aspect and organizational security. What, what are they, what are their concerns be? What, what do they view as the kind of emerging threat landscape?\n\nOkay, um, actually, in within industry, we also need to, we should also get the perspective of workers, of course. Um, employee at a small, medium, and large organization. One of each. Um, and one employee at a tech forward organization. Maybe even an AI company itself. How have they been using AI internally? Do they, do they feel any dissonance between what they're marketing and uh, what they're feeling from their own adoption of the tool?\n\nIndustry analysis layer—um, simulated analyst. Sector analyst, it's a company like McKinsey, whose task is to provide dispassionate analysis of, you know, they're used to advising industry upon the trends as they see them. And their task is to, is to give a speech presenting a their, their viewpoint. The vantage point from the consulting side of things, let's say. Um, I want to include a couple of government actors as well, so the um, the Prime Minister of a simulated country who arrives in a simulated motorcade. That was just a joke. Um, and its perspective can be—again, we'll have to pass the name of a fictitious country. You're, you're very, you know, the most high-level person in your, in your country as such, you're, you're worried about your citizens. What do, what does AI mean to you? What do you feel about its role in society at large? Um, one from the, a municipal level, uh, government person, like the, maybe the mayor of a of a town who might be sort of leadership in roll out, municipal roll out of AI technology.\n\nUh, one perspective that would be great would be Smart City, a Smart City Planner. Very, very specific, very much, you know, implementation level. Um, and put very stringent requirements for security and cybersecurity. Have they been making what use of AI? What are they feeling about it at the moment? Um, next one, I think should be an AI skeptic. Someone who's remember the population who's been somehow invited to this symposium who's just like extremely negative and critical about everything related to AI. Um, their task is to really tear apart AI today and cast a dim view over its future. Next one, AI hyper-enthusiast. Maybe an AI consultant. Could be someone like me. Um, they're mega-enthusiastic about AI. They live and breathe it. And they're here to just kind of spread their dogma. In so they're the like kind of extreme, extreme—um, in fact, I think this could be split into two. One consultant who's kind of just standard enthusiastic about AI. The next one is someone who actually thinks our, our adoption of AI is incredibly slow. They're actually saying: “Yeah, we're b- we're using it, but we're not using it in anywhere near as much as we could be and as far reaching and we're, we're cavemen who think we're high-tech.” Uh, the next one—so these are kind of just perspectives from, like, general society.\n\n### Education and Professions\n\nThis would be really fascinating. I hope this turns out well. We'll, we'll see what comes of this. Um, educational layer participants—simulated provost of a university. What are they seeing among, among, their feelings about AI in higher tech? Uh, headmaster of a, uh, of a high school. Career counselor at a high school. What are they advising that population about AI? They're, you know, people who are maybe choosing their college course, trying to figure out what to do with their careers, their lives. What kind of, what are they hearing from people they're counseling, and what are they um, what are they thinking? Speak speaking of counseling, one who is uh, legal, a lawyer. Uh, regular lawyer in a in a medium-sized city in, in, in tech, whatever, calling our fake country, Republic of Techland. And they just—I guess what's interesting here is: “Okay, you're you're involved in, in uh, in a leg-, in in in law. Um, are you using AI? Are you seeing your colleagues use AI? Do you think it's actually helpful? Do you think it's overhyped?” Uh, next one, I'm trying to think of other kind of traditional or classic professions: architects. My wife's an architect, so it's uh, close, close to me. Um, same questions, really. What have you made of it so far? Do you feel, are you, maybe are some, some specific ones. Are you using cloud AI? Are you using local AI? Are you using ComfyUI? Does your business, does your uh, office own a GPU? What do your colleagues make of it? Um, engineering is another one. Uh, doctor, a family doctor.\n\nThis would really be like kind of just gamut, scanning the—it's like what Anthropic's AI perspective tried recently, but, but with agents. Um, family doctor and then a consultant. So, kind of the most the level of medicine that the most people deal with day to day in the population: “Are you using it for diagnosis? Be honest. Um, do you find it helpful? Have you used it for your personal health? How often have you looked up patient's uh, symptoms on a, on ChatGBT while they're while they don't see your screen? Are you using specialist AI tools?” Because there's some of those have kind of come on the market grounded in medical journals, or are you just, are you just using ChatGBT? Um, I'm leaving out so many things. Uh, utility operator, again, operational technology. Um, academia. No, before I talk about academia, actually there's a very important one: parenting. Parenting expert. Um, what are you advising parents upon AI and, and children? Like when, uh, ethics, exposure, safety risks. Um, a children's education expert. Kind of the same question, but very focused on the role of this role in, like, education: “Can you, what do we do about kids shows that are made by AI? Do we need to, like, check them as carefully as other content?” Um, I'm particularly enthusiastic about the idea of using generative AI for kind of kids' content, actually. It's one of my secret uh, long-term AI aspirations, and I've done a few kind of little lullabies and funny songs on Suno, so I, I'd like to get a an enthusia-, fellow enthusiast on our panel who also thinks it can be bring a lot of joy to children. Um, that is, that is good.\n\nUm, AI censorship and bias. Representative of a think tank exploring AI bias. Um, what it means, where we are, where the big model labs are. Speaking of the big model labs, someone from the big model lab, a big model lab who's there to share their vision for what they want to do in, in this year. Someone from a small model lab, an open-coming model lab who's trying to break through and break out in a increasingly crowded market. Um, someone who's doing kind of the stuff that I do, AI consultancy. They're working with at the kind of ground level, um, working with businesses, implementing AI. What do you feel, like what, what have you, what have you heard so far from your clients about their challenges, opportunities? Um, do you worry about the fact that it's going to be, it's a booming market? Everyone's going to brand themselves as a um, as an AI consultant. Uh, speaking of that train of thought, one about upskilling and training. Maybe someone who does this for living, they advise people upon career upskilling and continuous professional development. Um, what have they seen so far in terms of skill gaps? What have they heard about skill gaps from employers? What are they advising people? Um, I will try to do some silence truncation on this voice note. Uh, I think we've got a pretty diverse, pretty good cross-section of society already here, but uh, I feel like there's still many gaps. Yeah. Um, totally unredacted audio including gross sounds of me drinking water. AI in foreign policy, because it's something I'm so interested in. This idea of decision making and AI—we kind of covered a government, but um, I'd love to act-, actually—oh, here's one: military. Um, probably wouldn't happen in the real world, or maybe it would, but a military technologist comes to speak to the conference about and actually shares what they can in the open domain about how the army's using AI or the military. Um, how significant it is in in modern warfare. What the challenges are in terms of defense in AI. Um, and then the geopolitical dimension would be really fascinating too—East versus West. Someone comes to the conference who represents a Chinese uh, AI vendor, talks about the differences between AI adoption in the East and the West to date. Um, and what over there in uh, in China, or, you know, other places in the East, in the East of the world, they're seeing um, AI—the the dynamics they're seeing.\n\nAlso be fascinating actually to get someone from a developing, lower less developed country, um, talking about how AI, the kind of maybe developmental aspect of AI in terms of access to it. Affordability is f- arguably in places where it maybe might make the biggest impact. One, speaking of impact, an advocate for impact as a field, commonly associated with a field called impact investing. Uh, their perspective is on just kind of what they're seeing in terms of use, where where they're excited about AI. Um, that brings us nicely to actually some the fact the world of finance: a financial regulator, a central banker, uh, AI's use in making sense of, you know, the kind of giant heaps of data we see in uh, in the world of economics that moves quicker than people can get that information. Um, a trader, a day trader, someone using AI tools in their, in their uh, in their actual trading strategies. Uh, one who represents someone maybe more like me, just, like, a regular, regular chump uh, with a pension, trying to make sure that they're, you know, they're putting their money in in a smart way. Um, what's their perspective been? And then someone who advises the regular chumps, like me, on this kind of stuff. Um, like a, like a regular financial advisor, not, not, not to um, not to kind of the, the rich and the famous, but to just regular savers. Um, someone from a non-English speaking country. I remember the population who can speak English and they, they share what the AI looks like in, in small languages. Let's take someone from Denmark, a pretty, fairly small language. And what's the, what's the scene like over there as in, you know, the big models are trained on English and let's take someone who, who in that population who doesn't know English. And those less, those languages which have less speakers, how is AI, like what are the tools like? Is it, are is it still kind of, like, are they, are they, like, significantly worse than the—someone who, someone from, let's say, Denmark, again, who has, because they're a Danish speaker, they've used both um, let's say tools just marketed for their language and conventional tools, like ChatGBT, and they're able to kind of see from their own experience the differences there. Um, here's a random one: someone who's uh, um, producer at Netflix. And they're challenged by AI-generated content in the productions they're assessing, and what the policies are like there. Another one that I've actually been involved with through um, through work stuff is the publishing industry. Someone at a major publisher—we cannot, we can use proxies for all of these. I think it makes it more, more fun when and that takes away the kind of copyright—speaking of copyrights, the kind of, you know, potential to create a fake AI persona based on a real named entity that then says something uh, very much out of, out of brand or whatever. Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll come up with a fake publisher uh, that represents someone like a big name in publishing. And they're looking, of course, are their authors using AI to generate books that they're vetting for publication, and maybe that they're representing. Um, let's also create a model-published author. They've already published a book—not self-published, but published in the mainstream. Are they using AI? They probably know other published authors. Um, are they using AI, too? Speaking of the world of writing and content, a journalist, um, and a copy editor. Some of the most nitpicky people one can ever hope to encounter or not hope. Um, what are, what, what are their thoughts? I used to work with a couple of very entertaining copy editors. Um, are they, do they suspect their reporters are using AI all the time? Have they caught a reporter red-handed? And for the reporters, um, when they're writing, when they're, uh, writing and creating news that's going to be read by—if they're working for a busy newswire, potentially tens of millions of people—and the stakes are kind of high. They don't want to lose their job or become a news story themselves. Uh, how do they feel about approaching AI tools? Um, a religious leader—I'm Jewish, so a rabbi would be really interesting to me. Are you, are you using it for your uh, for your Torah lessons? Be honest. Um, and then someone from another, another faith—uh, Muslim cleric, uh, to hear the, ask the same question. I don't, again, I don't want to get into kind of very too much uh, politically charged uh, territories uh, or, or areas. Speaking of speak-, speaking of politically charged areas, um, we've talked about military and intelligence agency. Someone, a national intelligence agency sent someone um, in, you know, who's, who's can speak to the press. Um, and they disclose their feelings about AI. Uh, are they using it? They're obviously dealing with crazy amounts of data and trying to thwart um, organized crime? Um, maybe an organized crime person, like, like a mafioso who's been in our, in our imaginary experiment, they've been promised uh, promised uh, you know, non-prosecution or some, something. Here's another one: I, I'm, I think there's a huge potential use case for AI, a really powerful one, in fact, in what, in anonymization and obfuscation. Meaning people who might whistleblow, people who mightn't have felt, for various reasons, they couldn't come forth with um, with something, and AI as a language model, um, is amazing at just saying: “Take this, change all the names, change all the details, but keep the facts.” Um, and I think that there is, I don't, not sure I've actually seen any tool for this yet, although I've tried a couple of experimentary workflows myself. Um, and I don't know who we could get to represent this, but like a, you know, a serious issue where let's take, I don't know, sexual violence, domestic violence, where people are, are, you know, massively at fear of retribution or, or scared, and they might have to think creatively about their use of AI for this reason—to protect themselves. Um, have they thought about it? Have they heard of anyone doing this? What tools did they use? And oh, there's probably, like, a million and one other ones, um, but oh, thinking something very operational and data heavy, and I thought about the, the air transport industry. Real time. We didn't talk about the scientific sector—science, uh, data analysts. But I think for V1, I'll just keep that to that already pretty long list of personas. And okay, that's end of personas list. Now, because that's a lot of people—a lot of synthesized agents—I want to keep it short so that each one has three minutes, delivers a three-minute speech. Three minutes, we can compute what the average word speaking rate is, and then in the first pass, using Gemini 3, which is incredibly cost effective—and important note: using Gemini 3 with search enabled. Vital. So that we can have up-to-date grounding. That, that stage is absolutely essential because otherwise, we can't have agents reflecting on 2025 created with an AI model that thinks it's 2024. If that doesn't work, fallback can be to Vili, but that's an essential step, or perplexity, but I think Gemini will be good enough. So uh, the constraint in the first step of the experiment is each person has delivers a three-minute speech, which means Gemini generates enough text that it would take about three minutes to read. And then text to speech. For the text-to-speech layer, I don't know how many agents that amounted to. But I'm thinking two things, because the ultimate delivery lay-, delivery vehicle I see as being, this could be really interesting, would be the following. One is a PDF—just a text document. You, um, we take the outputs, give each uh, the title page, like “Agent 2 represents their name.” The name would be something like diplomat. The diplomatic corps would have been a good one, actually. Um, in foreign policy. Maybe for V2. Uh, so there's a title and then just a short description: “This agent is instructed to represent a model proxy for a um, McKinsey person. This was their response.” Then the agent response. Then next page. So that, that's just basically concatenating responses into, into a PDF. But the format that I personally like the best, and I think would be way more, way more enjoyable to listen to—if they are only three minutes each, so it's fairly short and snappy—TTS. And I'd like to also have because it's auditory—um, an MC, which can be a stable voice. And the MC just introduces each speaker because otherwise, we don't know who they're, who they're, which agent this is. So the MC voice will say: “Next speaker is Agent 3. Agent 3 is representing a investment banker focused on this.” Short introduction. And then a little pause before and after, which I've learned from my, my errors, is necessary because otherwise, you'll just go back to back. And then, uh, then the next agent. And then the concatenation logic there is is just putting all the audio chunks together, which I've worked, which I've done many times for podcasts and it actually works very, very well. The TTS, the actual only challenge I can think of is, is voices, voice diversity. Um, however many agents that is, I'm making a mental note to myself that I think I'll actually run this experiment for TTS using Resemble AI, as I like, I like their technology a lot. Um, I'm using it for my AI podcast. Offhand promotion called mywordprompts.com. And they have a huge voice library, so I can just pick, round up 30 voices so that we don't, you know, it's not you're not hearing different agents in the same voice and it sounds, it sounds off. So I'll select 30 voice IDs, spanning just different types of voices to give some variety. And finally, in the experiment, MC introduction—"Welcome to the conference”—and then after all the agents are over, a closure. Final step could be, like, kind of a a summary summarization agent, so after we've gathered all the individual responses, um, one agent who takes that huge heap of context data. Gemini 3, again, might actually handle this, because it, even aggregated, it's, it's probably within the context window, and its task is generating a summary. It can be a 10-minute, it can generate, again, text, and also an audio summary. I'm personally would find the, the first of those audio outputs the much more, the one I'm, I'd be much more excited about listening to: the direct perspectives. And we should add in the system prompt for the perspectives that they're told to just be yourself and talk as if you're at this conference. No formalities needed or or whatever. And that's the end of my experiment design. And I'm just going to place a note because what I was thinking, th- this is the stretch experiment that would be is kind of futuristic, but everything right now that seems futuristic becomes feasible in in AI pretty quickly. It's, it's very, very amazing. Um, I thought that avatars, like speaking avatars would be amazing for this, like literally, there's, I don't know if this could be done. I say that time and time again, and then people invent stuff that makes things possible. The background is, like, literally a podium or, you know, a stage. An avatar comes up, they speak as if it's, like, a TED conference or something. And then they go off stage, and then the next person comes up. So, like, an actual video. Less ambitious implementation will be just kind of talking heads. That could definitely be done, but um, it wouldn't be that fun to watch. But um, to keep it cheap and cheerful while experimenting and just trying out, can AI do this? This would be super cool. I'd love to try this. I'm going to just do the simple text and audio pattern, which doesn't actually end up being that expensive. And it's a very worthwhile use of a few dollars, in my opinion. So, that's the plan. I'm going to now send this transcription to Gemini. I'm going to deliberately include this transcription in the repository. Uh, just it's my new, it's my um, it's my method. I open-source the method and the and the occasionally useful results. And uh, it also, just as a, as a side point, is a useful one to do this with because it's over 30 minutes and it shows that multimodal models, multimodal audio models can actually process um, audio of this length and much more, which is actually very, very cool because that's my um, what I'm working on—a voice text solution. I can't say no more.",
